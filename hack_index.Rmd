### We're kicking off [**OpenCon London 2017**](http://www.opencon2017.org/opencon_2017_London) with a 
## **`2 track hack / creative collaborative coding event!`**

There'll be plenty of options to work on a variety of projects according to skills and interest. 

<br>

#### We are continuing with the core theme developed for [OpenCon Berlin 2016](https://annakrystalli.shinyapps.io/OpenConBerlin_reprohack/): 
## the **paper reproducibility hack!** (aka **#ReproHack17**)

We are all excited by the progress made by many to **make their papers fully reproducible by publishing code and data**. We know how challenging it can be so we want to showcase the value of the practice, both for original authors and and as a learning experience for the reproducers. 

Inspired by **Owen Petchey's** [**Reproducible Research in Ecology, Evolution, Behaviour, and Environmental Studies course**](https://github.com/opetchey/RREEBES), where students attempt to  reproduce the analyses and figures of a paper from the raw data, we want to attempt to do the same. While they take a few months over a number of sessions, we only have a day so instead we'll be trying to do the same but with **papers that have also published code**. 

What we love about this approach, and why we think it fits well in the space of a hack, is that it provides a low-pressure environment to actually get working with other people's code and data. Attempting reproduction provides an opportunity to test how reproducible papers are **'out of the box'**, enabling evaluation of how successful current practices are, identifying what worked and where the most pressing weaknessess are.

This is by no means an attempt to discredit work so consent by authors will be sought and their involvement is encouraged. We see reproduction as beneficial scientific activitiy in itself, with useful outcomes for the papers and valuable learning experiences for the participants. We hope to feedback our experiences to authors and of course spread the word on successful practice!

## Plus an **open source hack track**

For folks who want to get their hands dirty **contributing to open source projects for Open Science**, we'll also offer a collaborative coding track. The idea is for participants **to get together to create Open Science tools with a focus on reproducible research**. 

You don't have to be a coder to take part in the hack - **anyone with an interest in creating better tools for Open Science is invited**, from designers and researchers to librarians, project managers, communicators, and so on.

**We offer the opportunity for project leads to submit their projects for work.** Projects can either be for a completely new tool, or build on top of existing work. The only requirement is that you should have something to present at the end of the day, be that a concept, mock-ups or a working prototype.






### **a collaborative output:**

We want to **collaborativelly collate and communicate our experiences and outputs** during the session. By collating information and discussions openly through [**github**](https://github.com/features) and collaboratively contributing narrative, we hope to end up with at least a comprehensive blog post or potentially a short paper using [**overleaf**](https://www.overleaf.com/?utm_expid=71700200-7.jX1xSGOgQzGKvOn08hBHag.0).

### **Nominate a paper for #ReproHack2017:**

We invite nominations from anyone, especially if you would like to **test one of your own papers!** Either way, we encourage proponents to seek consent from the original authors for their nominations.



```{r, echo=FALSE}
library("shiny")
 wellPanel(a("Nominate Paper", class = "btn btn-primary btn-md", 
          href = "https://goo.gl/forms/xHWFILMaxTcZi7GC3"))
```



### **Nominate an Open Source project:**

We invite nominations from anyone, especially if you would like to **test one of your own papers!** Either way, we encourage proponents to seek consent from the original authors for their nominations.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
  wellPanel(a("Nominate an OS Project", class = "btn btn-primary btn-md", 
          href = "https://goo.gl/forms/DJoAHVDCeWlG92b03"))
```

          href = "javascript:history.go(0)"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(googlesheets)
suppressMessages(gs_auth(token = "googlesheets_token.rds", verbose = FALSE))
```


```{r, message=FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE,  echo=FALSE}
responses_gs <- gs_title("OpenCon Berlin Reproducibility Hack (Responses)")
responses <- gs_read(responses_gs)


for (i in 1:nrow(responses)){
    cat('\n')     
    cat('\n')
    cat('\n') 
    cat("### **", i,". ", as.character(responses[i, "Paper title"]), "**", "\n", "\n", sep = "") 
    cat("**", gsub("\n", "", gsub("[*]", "", as.character(responses[i, "Paper citation"]))), "\n**", "\n", "\n", sep = "")
    cat("##### *submitted by ", as.character(responses[i, "Name"]),"*", "\n")
    cat('\n')
    cat('\n')
    cat("**Why should we attempt to reproduce this paper?**", "\n", "\n")
    cat(as.character(responses[i, "Why should we attempt to reproduce this paper?"]), "\n")
    cat('\n')
    cat("**Paper URL:** [", as.character(responses[i, "Paper URL"]),"](",as.character(responses[i, "Paper URL"]) ,")", "\n")
    cat('\n')
    cat("**Data URL:**", as.character(responses[i, "Data URL"]), "\n")
    cat('\n')
    cat("**Code URL:**", as.character(responses[i, "Code URL"]), "\n")
    cat('\n', "\n")
    cat("**Required programming skills:**", as.character(responses[i, "Required programming skills"]), "\n")
    cat('\n', "\n",'\n')
